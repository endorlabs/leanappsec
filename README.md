# LeanAppSec Community Code of Conduct

## Preface
Endor Labs values a healthy LeanAppSec community where people feel safe - psychologically and physically - in their interactions with other members, both inside of Slack and beyond. To achieve this outcome, we are codifying our guidelines on behavior and interactions with one another. This Code of Conduct is a work in progress that will evolve with the LeanAppSec community. We value our community's input and welcome suggestions.

## Our Promise
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, neuro(a)typicality, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.
Community Membership
This community is for tech professionals who want to understand and improve application security. There is a membership vetting process to keep the interactions high-value and protect members from unsolicited product pitches. This community is not open to people in non-technical roles, such as recruiters, staffing agencies, account managers, and students.

Our Standards: Good Behavior
Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:
Using welcoming and inclusive language
Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community, and prioritizing marginalized people’s safety
Our Standards: Unacceptable Behavior
Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
The use of violent language or imagery
Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
Public or private harassment
Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission (doxxing)
Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, or employment
Unsolicited communications to members or posting in channels for commercial purposes (promoting a company, product, or service), including but not limited to DMing members for prospecting purposes or posting blatantly product-focused blogs
Any kind of scamming or spamming, including but not limited to excessive or unsolicited posting on topics not relevant to the community, phishing, spreading of misinformation, and use of bots
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all LeanAppSec community spaces and events, both online and offline, including but not limited to the LeanAppSec community Slack. 

While this Code of Conduct applies to LeanAppSec spaces, we still want to know if you are being harassed by a member of the LeanAppSec community outside our spaces. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment seriously.
Enforcement Responsibility
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at leanappsec@endor.ai. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Endor Labs’ Partner Code of Conduct supersedes this Code of Conduct when conflicting.

The LeanAppSec moderation team is Jenn Gile and Kadi McKean.
Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. Correction
Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2. Warning
Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

3. Temporary Ban
Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

4. Permanent Ban
Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
